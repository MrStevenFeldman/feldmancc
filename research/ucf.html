              <li>Founded by Dr. Damian Dechev in 2010</li>
              <li>Its mission is to discover, develop, and apply fundamental and practical solutions for the advancement of multicore and multiprocessor software. </li>
            </ul>


            <h3>My Contribution:</h3>
            <p>I was one of three founding members and my role was to esearch the design and implementation of multi-core algorithms, focusing on implements that provide high guarantees of progress within a system (non-blocking/lock-free/wait-free). My research resulted in the publication of new designs for wait-free versions of the hash map, ring buffer, multi-word compare and swap, vector algorithms.

            <h3> <a href="http://ucf-cs.github.io/Tervel/"> Tervel: </a> </h3>
            <p> I was the principal architecture, developer, and implementor of the Tervel framework. It unifies methodologies and techniques to enable the efficient implementation of wait-free algorithms. It includes a unified memory reclamation structure, progress assurance scheme, and a construct that limits recursive helping. It advocates a call-back centric design pattern to reduce code duplication, observable states, and improve code readability.
