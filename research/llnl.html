            I spent the summer of 2014 interning at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory(LLNL) where I was tasked with solving challenges related to the scalability and performance of distributed graph algorithms.
            My primary task was the reimplementation of their delegate graph partitioning algorithm to increase the maximum supported graph scale.
            Their original implementation was limited to graphs of scale 2<sup>30</sup> or less, my final implementation was capable of constructing graphs as large as scale 2<sup>40</sup>, a substantial improvement.
            Using my implementation, LLNL's Catalyst cluster tied for second, by problem scale, on the <a href="http://www.graph500.org/results_jul_2015?order=field_submission_scale_value&sort=desc">graph500's November 2014 benchmark report</a>, and as of the July 2015 report, it is still tied.
